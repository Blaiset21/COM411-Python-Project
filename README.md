Overview

This project was developed as part of an early university module focused on building foundational programming skills using Python. Its primary goal was to reinforce core programming concepts through hands-on coding exercises. Throughout the project, I explored key areas such as control structures, functions, file handling, data structures, and basic algorithmic thinking. It serves as a personal learning milestone and a showcase of my progression in Python development.
